# The Problem
Secret Hitler is a pretty popular social deception board game. The idea here is simple: We want to make a halfway decent web version of this.

The inspiration behind this was when a bunch of my friends and I got together virtually for board games. We played Secret Hitler a lot pre-pandemic, so we decided to play it online. It turns out there isn't a decent web app for it. The existing apps were either nice looking and extremely buggy or functional but extremely basic. In the end, we ended up using https://secret-hitler.com/, which fell into the latter category.

# MVP Requirements
- Support the game's basic rules and mechanics
- Support at least 1 player group size (the rules change based on this). I think 7-10 is the more common size.

You can use https://secret-hitler.com/ as a base. Just add more text to it as it's mainly icons based on the last time I tried it.

# Best Platform
**Web**

There's a good amount of stuff going on in this game; I think we need the real estate that web provides. You could build this on mobile, but I don't think it would be a great experience. Then again, I have often underestimated what people are willing to play on a tiny screen...

# Difficulty
**Hard**

This is a pretty complex app to build even though it's really a fancy utility app. You need to have a bunch of players come together and then you need to properly maintain the game state and push updates to everyone as the game progresses. There's also a lot of blocking operations like the vote. This is a project where just getting something decent working is already extremely impressive on its own.

# Possible Extensions
- User accounts
- Track statistics (win/loss ratio per player, win streaks, game length, etc)
- In-game chat
- The ability to start a new game automatically
- Animations as game state changes
